            <h1 class="header one" >The bubble</h1>

            <p class="para one" >I have reasons to believe we are currently
            going through a bubble. These reasons include
            the over evaluation in the modern tech industry, 
            but more specifically AI related companies. Bubbles 
            are fueled by: over evaluation, fear of missing out, 
            and the mix between possibilities and probabilities.

            <h2 class="header two" >Estimating the value of Nvidia</h2>

            <p class="para two" >First, what is Nvidia? Nvidia is a tech company
            specializing in one computer component, Graphics
            Processing units (GPU's for short) but all you need 
            to know is that these GPU's are essential for high level
            computing, which AI requires. Now when I was a kid 
            I knew this brand because of my obsession with video games,
            however they rebranded themselves as an "AI focused tech company".
            As a brief history lesson I'd like to compare Nvidia to a more 
            familiar name: Apple. Apple a year ago used to be the biggest company 
            in the world, and for good reason. You see Apple were pioneers of their 
            time. Apple popularized the graphical user interface, meaning, before 
            Apple, to make your computer do things, you had to type, and memorize commands,
            now you just simply click, or tap on your screen to make it do everything. Recently however, 
            Apple got overtaken as the largest company by Nvidia, with a market cap of over 
            4 trillion in January 2025. The reason for their dominance is simply because of AI. 
            Without the main AI company (OpenAI or as most know it Chatgpt) being publicly traded, 
            this leaves investors wanting to capitalize on AI growth to invest in companies correlated; 
            Nvidia. 

            </p>

            <h2 class="header three" >Why do I believe Nvidia is the most over valued company in the world?</h2>

            <h3 class="header four" >#1 The products themselves</h3>

            <p class="para three" >Nvidia only sells one type of product, GPU's, compared to Apple that sells 
            a plethora of products for clients with different tastes or needs, but  
            Nvidia is somehow more valuable than Apple? Now you might 
            question "well if the part they produce is essential for AI, then of course it's gonna be more of a valuable company" 
            however they're not the only company that produces GPU's. Companies like: Intel, and AMD also sell 
            very powerful GPU's. These competitor GPU's may not be as powerful but their not too far off. Lets 
            visualize this to actually grasp the difference in power, by comparing AMD, and Nvidia's Market caps. 
            AMD has a market cap of: 291 billion, and Nvidia having: 4.3 trillion in market cap. 
            Nvidia's market cap is over 14 times more valued than AMD's, but are Nvidia's GPU's 14 times better? 
            Not even remotely close, which leads me to my second reason.
            </p>

            <h3 class="header five" >#2 Over zealous investors</h3>

            <p class="para four" >Since Nvidia is the face of AI right now, this leads Investors to believe 
            the only way to directly invest in AI is Nvidia, which simply is not true. 
            This wrongfully drives up the price of Nvidia. By being the only name known 
            to the uneducated that don't know of AMD and other GPU manufacturers, they 
            think, and value Nvidia higher than the intrinsic value. This is only amplified by 
            "fear of missing out", investors want to invest early on new and revolutionary 
            technology to hopefully turn a profit, but do it wrongfully so in the process. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="header six" >#3 Investors and CEO's over estimating the profitability of AI</h3> 

            <p class="para five" >The promise and idea of AI and it's potential to generate more revenue are misleading, 
            and over inflated. Now, while there is money to be made with AI in the next 20 years, 
            most people are overestimating it's potential right now. For instance, Chatgpt or OpenAI, 
            is the fastest growing web application of all time, but how about we look at the revenue of this 
            company, I mean their the largest AI company in the world, surely they're making load of money right? 
            Nope, OpenAI made 3.7 billion dollars in revenue (2024). Well that sounds pretty good, until you realize they 
            ended up losing over <strong>5 billion dollars that year.</strong> Their costs far exceeding their revenue of 3.7 
            billion. The reason why a company who's whole business model is online lost so much money, is because the sheer cost 
            of computing power it takes an AI to generate a response. Projections of 2025 losses are supposed to be double of what 
            they lost last year. Computing costs alone are projected to reach 13 billion dollars in 2025. And here, the average 
            person thinks AI is some magical money printing machine, nope, so far its the opposite, its just really efficient at burning 
            energy and money.
            </p>

            <p class="para six">Note: This is not exclusive to just Nvidia and OpenAI but rather all the major 
            tech companies. Google, Meta(facebook), Apple, Microsoft, ect, have all seen major 
            increases in share pricing since the release of ChatGPT(2022) and implementing their own AI 
            into their platform.
            </p>

            <h2 class="header seven" >Now the scary part</h2>
            <img src="./maxresdefault.jpg" alt="graph"
            height="auto"
            width="300">
            <h2 class="header eight" >The similarities to the dot-com bubble, and AI bubble</h3>

            <h3 class="header nine" >Index funds</h3>

            <p class="para seven" >Now I'm sure you're familiar with Index funds like 
            the NASDAQ index, or the s&p 500, but a big part of the 
            dot-com bubble and its burst had to do with index funds. When these 
            .com companies were first founded, all the hype around them caused 
            an overvaluation of internet companies, thus influencing the prices 
            of the NASDAQ to rise by 582%. The similarity to today, leads in the percentage 
            share of the s&p 500. Since Nvidia is the biggest company in the world 
            it holds the greatest share of the s&p500 (over 7%). 
            </p>

            <h3 class="header ten" >The power of .com</h3>

            <p class="para eight" >In this era there were a lot of stupid overvaluations just for having 
            .com in their name. A prime example would be MIS International. Mis International 
            renamed to Cosmoz.com, and just from this insignificant change <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165176519301703#:~:text=MIS%20International%20traded%20for%2050%20cents%20a%20share%2C%20and%20when%20it%20changed%20its%E2%80%99%20name%20to%20cosmoz.com%20the%20price%20hit%20%245%20soon%20after." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> their stock price jumped 
            up 900%.</a> The correlation to today is the power of the name "AI" implies. 
            From personal experience almost half of all ads shown on my feeds from social media sites 
            are AI related. Wether its a new AI startup company , an AI video generator, or an AI teaching you 
            how to wash your balls, it seems as if everyday a new AI startup company pops up. Just having AI in 
            the name, or mentioned in the advertisements, makes the company seem more refined or futuristic. Making 
            other startups obsolete. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="header eleven" >Finally, the overvaluations</h3>

            <p class="para nine" >The biggest and root cause of the dot-com bubble 
            was just the sheer amount of expectations people had.
            Everybody thought that "The internet will change the world" 
            which isn't false, but took a lot longer than most suspected. 
            This rush caused (as previously stated) overvaluations in every company 
            with a .com attached to their name. Investors eager to capitalize on the potential 
            future profits of these companies caused almost everything to be overvalued. The same can be 
            said with AI. How much has AI actually impacted most peoples day to day? Not much. Aside 
            from seeing stupid AI videos on social media, majority of peoples lives stayed the same, 
            just as it was in the dot-com bubble. But the biggest overvaluation is the true profitability 
            of AI. If the biggest AI company isn't making any profit, how are these hundreds of startup AI 
            companies supposed to? Its the same as it was in the 2000's. All these .com/AI companies getting billion 
            dollar evaluations, but still have $0 in profit. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="header twelve" >How can you capitalize on this?</h3>

            <p class="para ten" >With limited capital, substantial gains requires leverage. 
            A way to use leverage would be put options. As I'm sure you know, put options 
            are contracts that let you bet against the market, but there is a downside. The downside 
            being theta aka the rate of decay. Theta is a value given to an option, and this value represents 
            the loss the option will take each day it gets closer to expiration. Now, any sane person will tell you, 
            that its almost impossible to time the market, and in this case it is especially true. While there were turning 
            points that caused the dot-com bubble to burst, like the fed increasing interest rates causing investors to re evaluate 
            their portfolio, this doesn't mean the same will happen again. So theres two options. Option one being to buy a contract 
            further out from expiration. When options are further out from expiration, the less theta decay, the reverse is also true. 
            However you still will lose money everyday even if the stock price stays the same. Now option two is riskier, but with greater risk 
            comes greater returns. Option two would be instead to <strong>Sell</strong> a call option. Now buying a call option would mean betting 
            the market will go up, however selling a call is betting the option price will go down. This also means that we profit from theta decay. 
            each day even if the stock price stays the same you'll profit from theta. This will also mean you can hold your position longer without it 
            becoming a liability. The risks however are exponentially more dangerous. When selling a call option you have the chance of not just losing the 
            money you invested, but also to go negative. In the same way buying a stock has "infinite" potential gain, selling a stock, or option in this case has 
            a hypothetical infinite loss. This is, of course very unlikely, but the rewards are far greater.
